    <h1>Java Aspect Component FAQ</h1>

    <p>This FAQ lists a few general interest questions and a few common
    problems that you may encounter while using JAC. If your question
    is not listed here, do not hesitate to use the <a
    href="/contacts.html">mailing lists</a> to ask for some help.</p>

    <h2><a name=general>General interest questions</a></h2>

    <h3><a name=AOP>Aspect-Oriented Programming</a></h3>

    <h4 class=question><a name=whatisAOP>What is Aspect-Oriented
	Programming?</a></h4>

    <p>Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm and
      philosophy that improves Separation of concerns when developping
      complex softwares. JAC core provides an AOP technology and this
      is why JAC applications are very simple to develop and very
      maintanable. AOP also improves reusability of software
      components.</p>

    <h4 class=question><a name=whatisAC>What is an Aspect Component?</a></h4>
    
    <p>An Aspect Component is a reusable technical unit in JAC. For
      instance, the persistence or the authentication in JAC are
      implemented whitin Aspect Components which are totally
      independant from the rest of the code. An Aspect Component can
      be dynamically added / removed (we say it is woven /
      unwoven).</p>

    <h4 class=question><a name=oneAC>Can I use only one aspect
	component for my application (e.g. persistence)?</a></h4>

    <p>This is possible. However, the real advantages of AOP comes
      when several concerns crosscut. For this reason, we strongly
      advice to program fully aspect-oriented applications.</p>
 
    <h4 class=question><a name=JACvsAspectJ>What are the differences
	between JAC and AspectJ?</a></h4>

    <p>JAC is very similar to AspectJ in the employed programming
      concepts (pointcuts, advices (=wrapping methods), joinpoints).</p>

    <p>The main differences come from the implementation that allows
    dynamic aspect weaving/unweaving (the aspects can be added/removed
    without compiling and stopping the application). Moreover, JAC is
    a framework so it does not defines a new langage or compiler (it
    can be used as regular Java, in any development environment).</p>

    <p>The dynamic aspect weaving has a cost on performances which is
      due to the java.lang.reflect use. A joinpoint in JAC has an
      overhead that is similar to the reflection cost in Java (greatly
      optimized in java 1.4 but still slower than a regular
      call). Most of the time, this overhead is very neglectable
      compared to the aspects inherent overhead (e.g. a persistence
      aspect). However, it makes JAC not very suited to all the kind
      of AOSD. This pb will be overcome soon with static joinpoints
      (made through a compilation process).</p>

    <p>Another main difference is that JAC comes with a set of
      ready-to-use aspect components. To reuse an aspect component,
      you just need to write a configuration program that is
      declarative (not far from a DSL). Thus the final user does not
      need to know anything about the actual aspect
      implementation.</p>

    <p>Finally, JAC provides support for distributed pointcuts
      (pointcuts that can extend programs that are distributed on
      several JAC containers). This feature can be used to efficiently
      program distributed aspects such as fault-tolerance,
      data-consistency, load-balancing, or caching. All these can be
      useful for clusturing JAC containers.</p>

    <h4 class=question><a name=JACvsAspectJSyntax>Can you give me a
      brief overview on the differencies between JAC and AspectJ
      syntaxes?</a></h4>

    <p>The main difference regarding the programming is that AspectJ
      is a new language and that JAC is a framework.</p>

<p>Let us take a simple aspect:</p>

<pre class=code>
*** AspectJ version ***

aspect Sample {

  pointcut setter() : target(Point) && 
      (call(void setX(int)) || call(void setY(int)));

  void around() : setter() {
     System.out.println("about to set something");
     proceed();
     System.out.println("something was set");       }
}
</pre>

<pre class=code>
*** JAC version ***

class SampleAC extends AspectComponent {

   public SampleAC() {
       pointcut("ALL","Point",
                "setX(int):void || setY(int):void",
                new AWrapper(this), "printSomething");
   }

   public AWrapper extends Wrapper {
       public AWrapper(AspectComponent ac) { super(ac); }
       public void printSomething(Interaction interaction) {
          System.out.println("about to set something");
          proceed(interaction);
          System.out.println("something was set");            }
   }
}
</pre>

    <p>But if you want to generically capture all the getters in your
      pointcut, one of the great advantages of JAC is that you can use
      generic keywords:</p>

<pre class=code>
pointcut("ALL","Point","SETTERS", new AWrapper(), "printSomething");
</pre>

    <p>This feature is possible because of the bytecode analysis of
      the classes performed at load-time. JAC implements an algorithm
      that detects which methods read or write fields, references or
      collections. This feature simplifies the programming of aspects
      and can be used to implement aspects such as caching aspects
      (MODIFIERS keyword), persistency, etc.</p>


    <h4 class=question><a name=overhead>What is the overhead of
      bytecode analysis and dynamic weaving?</a></h4>

    <p>The bytecode analysis slows down the classes loading time by a
      5 factor. However, JAC caches the result of the translation so
      that this overhead is only noticeable on the first program
      launch.</p>

    <p>The dynamic aspect weaving has a cost on performances which is
      due to the java.lang.reflect use. A joinpoint in JAC has an
      overhead that is similar to the reflection cost in Java (greatly
      optimized in java 1.4 but still slower than a regular
      call). Most of the time, this overhead is very neglectable
      compared to the aspects inherent overhead (e.g. a persistence
      aspect). However, it makes JAC not very suited to all the kind
      of AOSD. This pb will be overcome soon with static joinpoints
      (made through a compilation process).</p>

    <h3><a name=JACvsJ2EE>JAC and J2EE</a></h3>
    
    <h4 class=question><a name=AS>Can JAC be regarded as an
    application server?</a></h4>

    <p>YES, YES, YES!! JAC is a very flexible container that can
      dynamically add technical services through aspects.</p>

    <h4 class=question><a name=J2EE>Is JAC J2EE compliant?</a></h4>

    <p>The answer is NO! JAC implements its own standards for the
      moment. Some parts of J2EE implementations could be reused in
      the future but most of them will simply not fit. In fact, the
      JAC Aspect-Oriented technology implements generalized and
      improved separation of concerns compared to J2EE.</p>

    <h4 class=question><a name=POJO>What is a POJO?</a></h4>

    <p>JAC components are not EJBs, they are POJOs (Plain Old Java
      Objects). A POJO is a component that does not implement any
      specific interface (on contrary to EJBs that must fullfill
      specific features to run on a J2EE container). With AOP, it is
      easy to make componants POJOs because it is the aspects that
      automatically and dynamically extends the objects to make them
      run on the JAC container.</p>

    <h4 class=question><a name=JDO>Does JAC implement JDO?</a></h4>

    <p>JAC does not implement JDO since JDO is a particular implementation
      of a persistence aspect. In JAC, we use a JAC-based persistency
      aspect that can be compared to JDO in many ways except that it
      enters into an Aspect-Oriented logic and standardization. Thus, our
      persistence aspect is fully compliant with other JAC aspects.</p>
    
    <p>Several JDO implementation pieces could be reused whithin our
      persistence aspect such as an O/R mapping or a query engine. For
      the moment, our implementation is simple, but greatly deals with
      references and collections (this is easy with aspects:).</p>

    <h4 class=question><a name=interfacing>Can JAC be interfaced whith
	non-JAC clients?</a></h4>

    <p>JAC can be accessed via RMI using the <code
      class=package>org.objectweb.jac.core.dist</code> API. However, we encourage
      developpers to implement full-JAC applications since the
      benefits of aspects can also be seen at client-side. For
      instance, at client-side, you can use the GUI aspect, the
      remote-access aspect (to invoke servers), caching aspect (for
      performance) and local persistence aspect. Programming
      distributed applications is not well documented but you can ask
      for support about it. Anyway, it will be improved in the
      future.</p>

    <h4 class=question><a name=JSP>Does JAC supports WEB developments?
	Can we use JSP with JAC?</a></h4>

    <p>JAC generates GUI with the GUI aspect (like any technical
      concern). JAC distribution includes Jetty so that JAC GUIs can
      be either Swing or WEB. JSP can be used to access JAC containers
      but, once again, you lose the benefits of the "all is aspect"
      philosophy.</p>

    <h3><a name="web">Web issues</a></h3>

    <h4 class="question"><a name="apache">Can JAC be used with Apache?</a></h4>

    <p>Yes, you if you have a site rnning with Apache, you can keep it
    and just tell Apache to redirect some requests to JAC. Here's how
    to do it (tested with Apache 1.3).</p>

    <ol>
      <li>You must have the proxy and rewrite modules enabled in httpd.conf:
	<pre>
LoadModule rewrite_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_rewrite.so
LoadModule proxy_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_proxy.so
</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Add a rewrite rule like this:
	<pre>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^/org/objectweb/jac/(.*) http://localhost:8088/org/objectweb/jac/$1 [P]
</pre>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a name=license>Licence</a></h3>

    <h4 class=question><a name=GPL>The GPL is known as
	"infectious". Do I have to distribute my own programs and
	aspects under the GPL ?</a></h4>

    <p>No. These are not considered derivative works. This is
      explicitly stated at the beginning of the LICENCE
      file. Moreover, JAC is now distributed under the LGPL.</p>

    <h2><a name=technical>Technical problems and issues</a></h2>

    <h3><a name="misc_tech">Misc.</a></h3>

    <h4 class=question><a
	name="misc_ex1">java.lang.IllegalAccessException</a></h4>

    <p>If you get a <code
      class=class>java.lang.IllegalAccessException</code> such as the
      following one, it probably means that you have a non public
      class &lt;myPackage.myClass&gt;.</p>

<pre class="code" style="font-size: smaller">
java.lang.IllegalAccessException: &lt;myPackage.myClass&gt;
        at java.lang.Class.newInstance0(Native Method)
        at java.lang.Class.newInstance(Class.java:237)
        at org.objectweb.jac.aspects.gui.InputWrapper.askForParameters(InputWrapper.java:88)

</pre>
    
    <h4 class=question><a name="#acc_keyword">Parser error in acc file</a></h4>

    <p>Some aspect configuration file gives a parser error like that:</p>

<pre class=output>
Syntax error
Couldn't repair and continue parse
ERROR: user.acc:1
ERROR: Parser error in user.acc : java.lang.Exception: Can't recover from previous error(s)
--- configuring session aspect ---
</pre>

    <p>And the line of the error looks fine:</p>

<pre class="code">
setUserClass calcul.Person email password profile;
</pre>

    <p>Aspects define block keywords that can be used to group
      configuration items in .acc files. <code>profile</code> is one
      of them and is defined by the user aspect. If you want to use
      such a word not as a keyword, you must enclose it between double
      quotes:</p>

<pre class="code">
setUserClass calcul.Person email password "profile";
</pre>

    <h3><a name=distribution>Distribution</a></h3>

    <h4 class=question><a name="dist_ex1">java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.objectweb.jac.core.dist.rmi.RMIRemoteContainer_Stub</a></h4>

    <p>rmiregistry's <code class=envvar>CLASSPATH</code> is probably
      wrong. You should kill all rmiregistry processes and try
      again. You may also try to rebuild all classes.</p>
    
    <h4 class=question><a name="rmi_bug">RMI does not manage to resolve
    hosts under Linux</a></h4>

    <p>Because of the way rmi works, you should not have
    "127.0.0.1&nbsp;&lt;your_local_hostname&gt;" in <code
    class=file>/etc/hosts</code></p>


    <h4 class=question><a name="dist_ex2">NoClassDefFoundError: org/objectweb/jac/core/dist/DistdClassLoader at org.objectweb.jac.core.dist.Distd.&lt;init&gt;</a></h4>

    <p>Check that a <code class=file>.java.policy</code> is properly
      configured.</p>
