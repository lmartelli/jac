    <div class=subtitle>A flexible framework for Distributed & Dynamic
      Aspect-Oriented Programming in Java</div>

    <h1>Technical issues summary</h1>

    <h2>Architecture overview</h2>

    <p>JAC aspect-oriented features and framework are based on a
      dynamic wrapping system that is used to weave the aspects
      together within the application. The global framework is further
      explained and represented in the following figure.</p>

    <p>The key feature of the JAC framework are <i>dynamic
      wrappers</i>, also called <i>generic advices</i> in relation to
      the aspect-oriented terminology (see
      <a href="javadoc/org/objectweb/jac/core/Wrapper.html" target=Javadoc>
      org.objectweb.jac.core.Wrapper</a>). A dynamic wrapper is defined in as a
      regular stand-alone object (i.e. it contains fields that form its
      states and methods that define it functionalities). However, a
      dynamic wrapper can implement several methods that have special
      semantics. Generally speaking, a dynamic wrapper is an object
      that defines behaviours that are not stand-alone since they must
      be applied to a regular object to be activated.

    <p>When a dynamic wrapper (generic advice) wraps (is applied to) a base
      object, the reference of the base object is not changed so that it
      does not disturb the clients. A base object can be wrapped by as many
      wrappers as needed and the set of wrappers is called a <i>wrapping
	chain</i> (or an advices chain).</p>

    <p>Dynamic wrappers can define 3 kinds of methods in addition to regular
      methods that defines the functional interface of the advice itself:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><i>wrapping methods</i>: they can perform treatments
	<i>before</i> and <i>after</i> the regular objects methods
	they are applied to.</li>
      
      <li><i>role methods</i>: that can extend regular objects
	interfaces (similarly to the <i>introduce</i> statement in
	AspectJ).  </li>
      
      <li><i>exception handlers</i>: that can handle exceptions that
	are raised by server objects in the object the wrapper is
	applied to.  </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The definition of which generic advice (dynamic wrapper) will
      be applied to which regular object is done within special
      components called <b><i>Aspect Components</i></b> (see <a
      href="javadoc/org/objectweb/jac/core/AspectComponent.html"
      target=Javadoc>org.objectweb.jac.core.AspectComponent</a>). In the AOP
      terminology, we say that this components define the pointcuts
      with-tin the base program.</p>

    <p>In order to allow the aspect components to easily define
      pointcuts, some extra meta-informations must be constructed by
      the JAC system. These extra informations are:</p>

    <ul> 
      <li>a runtime meta-model defined in the <a
	  href="javadoc/org/objectweb/jac/core/rtti/package-summary.html"
	  target=Javadoc>org.objectweb.jac.core.rtti</a> package and that the aspects use
	instead of the <code>java.lang.reflect</code> package since it is more
	precise, more flexible, faster, and (the last but not the least)
	aspects compliant</li>

      <li>a internally defined MOP specified by the <a
	  href="javadoc/org/objectweb/jac/core/BaseProgramListener.html"
	  target=Javadoc>org.objectweb.jac.core.BaseProgramListener</a>) interface which is
	implemented by all the aspect components and by the aspect component
	manager of the JAC system (see <a
	  href="javadoc/org/objectweb/jac/core/ACManager.html" target=Javadoc>class
	  org.objectweb.jac.core.ACManager</a>).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thus, a JAC application composed of regular object can be
      aspectized by programming a set of aspect components that
      extends its core behaviour. The aspect components install the
      dynamic wrappers when they receive events from the internal MOP
      defined by <a
      href="javadoc/org/objectweb/jac/core/BaseProgramListener.html"
      target=Javadoc>org.objectweb.jac.core.BaseProgramListener</a>. This
      installation (creation of new wrappers and linkages with the
      base objects) create new dedicated MOPs that allow the
      modification of the base objects behaviours.</p>

    <p>Notice also that the aspect parts of the application implement
	the <a
	href="javadoc/org/objectweb/jac/core/CollaborationParticipant.html"
	target=Javadoc>org.objectweb.jac.core.CollaborationParticipant</a> interface
	that allows them to retrieve some contextual information about
	what is happening in the base program (a collaboration is the
	reification of a set of interactions between some objects).</p>

    <h2>Bytecode translation</h2>
    
    <p>JAC uses <a
	href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel/">BCEL</a>
	to translate the regular object classes of the application so
	that they become wrappable. BCEL works at bytecode
	load-time so that the source code of the application is not
	needed (an aspect can be applied to a previously programmed
	application). The class files are not changed on disk so that
	a JAC application class can be used by regular Java programs.</p>

    <p>For more details about how the bytecode translation is
      performed, see the <a
      href="javadoc/org/objectweb/jac/core/WrappeeTranslator.html"
      target=Javadoc>org.objectweb.jac.core.WrappeeTranslator</a> and <a
      href="javadoc/org/objectweb/jac/core/WrappeeTemplate.html"
      target=Javadoc>org.objectweb.jac.core.WrappeeTemplate</a> classes.</p>

    <h2>Aspects granularity and dynamicity</h2>
    
    <p>JAC is a more framework than a new language. On contrary to <a
      href="http://aspectj.org">AspectJ</a> that focuses on defining
      new languages constructs to define crosscutting and aspects, JAC
      focuses on dynamicity and composition of aspects. Since JAC
      works at runtime and on a per-object basis, it is more suitable
      for distributed programming since an aspect can be dynamically
      applied or removed during the execution of the application and
      on a subset of instances.</p>

    <h1>Distributed Programming</h1>

    <p>JAC's final goal is to propose an extension that can be used to
      easily construct distributed applications in an Aspect-Oriented
      fashion. We are currently working on a programming model for
      Aspect-Oriented Distributed Programming that is based on groups
      of objects.</p>
