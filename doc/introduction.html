    <div class=subtitle>Renaud Pawlak and the JAC development team</div>

<p>AOP has been first introduced by Gregor Kickzales in 1996. Like
      structured programming and Object-Oriented programming
      introduced a new approach for designing programs and a set of
      guidelines to make more readable and reusable code, AOP is a
      philosophy that is related to style of programming. It addresses
      issues that can be solved in other approaches, but in a more
      elegant way. To understand the spirit of AOP, you must
      understand the following issues: 

<ul><li><b>separation of concerns</b>: referring the Law of Demeter, a 
project's efficiency increases if all the concerns are well modularized
and if you only have to speak to your direct friends to make a
modification of the program (this is a very old principle and the OOP
gives some answers)</li>

<li><b>crosscutting</b>: in a complex system, there are always some
concerns that are not easily modularized, especially common-interest
concerns that, by essence, are used by several modules (i.e. several
modules use/share a well-known service of a module -- such as a
logging or a persistence service)</li>

<li><b>dependencies inversion</b>: the best way to avoid crosscutting is to
NOT use the well-known services that crosscut. This is possible by
reversing the dependencies (i.e. the well-known service shall use the
other modules instead of the contrary). This dependency inversion is
implemented by aspects</li>
</ul>

<p>JAC furnishes a set of programming concepts that allows the user to
      implement the dependency inversion in a clean way.

<p>Here is a core business class that performs simple calculi:

<pre class=code>
public class Calcul {
    int value=0;
    public void add(int toadd) {
        value+=toadd;
    }
    public void sub(int tosub) {
        value-=tosub;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Let us imagine that, in the application, we do not want the <code>value</code>
      field to be negative. This is a constraint that will also be
      applicable to all the other classes of the application since, in
      this business, we don't want to see negative values.

<p>Thus, the test that will be added to check that the value is never
      negative will <i>crosscut</i> all the business classes and pollute
      the code that will be harder to read an maintain. Moreover, in an
      application where the constraint is different or where there is
      no constraints at all, my business classes will be harder to
      re-use as is.

<p>JAC and its AOP features allows you to externalize all the tests
      within a well modularized code called an <i>aspect
      component</i>. The effect of this code is to actually reverse
      the dependency between the code that performs the business
      calculi and the code that tests the constraints. Here is the
      aspect code:  

<pre class=code>
01> public class TestAC extends AspectComponent {
02>     public TestAC() {
03>         pointcut( "Calcul", "sub", LimiterWrapper.class, "limit" );
04>     }
05>     public class LimiterWrapper extends Wrapper {
06>         public void limit(Interaction i) {
07>             if(((Integer)getFieldValue(i.wrappee,"value")).intValue()
08>                    - ((Integer)args[0]).intValue() < 0 )
09>                 throw new Exception("<0 forbidden");
10>             proceed();
11>        }
12>        ...
13>}   }
</pre>

<p>Of course it is more complex than adding a simple line of test but
      in the long term and for real complex applications the benefits
      are huge.

<p>Aspect code explaination:

<ul><li>line 3: a <i>pointcut</i> denotes a set of points of the
	application where the aspect will change something (here, the
	example is so simple that it only affects the <code>sub</code>
	method of the <code>calcul</code> class, but it could denote a
	much more complex set of objects or methods --- hence a
	possibility to generalize the process to all the business
	classes)</li>

<li>line 5-6: a <i>wrapper</i> is an object that wraps the points
	defined by the pointcuts with new code.
	Here, the code is the one that is defined by the wrapping
	method <code>limit</code></li>

<li>line 7: the actual test. Within a wrapper, we have access to the
	interaction-related information (or joinpoint). Here, we know
	that <code>i.args[0]</code> is the parameter of the method
	that is associated to the interaction and that
	<code>i.wrappee</code> is the calcul object. So we can test
	them and throw an exception if the <code>value</code> field is
	negative.</li>

<li>line 9: the test failed, so we can run the <code>sub</code>
	method. <code>proceed</code> is a special method of wrappers
	that allows the programmer to ask for the realization of the
	current joinpoint (continue the interaction).</li>
</ul>

<p>JAC provides 2 levels to play with aspects:

<ul><li>the <b>programming level</b> (where you can program totally
new aspects) that is hard to understand for a beginner -- this is the
same level as AspectJ</li> 

<li>the <b>configuration level</b> (where you can customize existing
aspects to make them work with your application). This level is
supported by a configuration language with a generic syntax (or any
supported by JAC such as XML) that allows the programmer to call
configuration methods on existing aspects. In the JAC philosophy, it
is very important to understand that you do not need to program
aspects to use AO features. We furnish a set of aspects with
easy-to-use configuration methods so that even the programmers that
don't know anything about AOP can use aspects. For instance, imagine
that we program the <code>TestAC</code> aspect so that it provides a
configuration method instead of a hardcoded pointcut:

<pre class=code>
public class TestAC extends AspectComponent {
    final int bound = 0;
    public addTest(String classes, String methods, int bound) {
        pointcut( classes, method, LimiterWrapper.class, "limit" );
        this.bound = bound;
    }
    public class LimiterWrapper extends Wrapper {
        public void limit(Interaction i) {
            if(((Integer)getFieldValue(i.wrappe,"value")).intValue()
	          - ((Integer)i.args[0]).intValue() < bound )
                throw new Exception("<"+bound+" forbidden");
            return proceed(i);
        }
        ...
}   }
</pre>

Then you can use the aspect just by writing a configuration file such
	  as (this is easy so I do not explain it):

	<pre class=code>
addTest "Calcul" "sub" 0;
	<pre>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, JAC furnishes a set of aspects and an environment for
	distribution (deployment, remote communication, sessions,
	authentication, web interface). All the aspect features also
	work when the application is distributed so that you can write
	aspects that have global and distributed influence on the
	application. A set of aspects that implement
	distribution-related concerns such as consistency,
	broadcasting or load-balancing are provided by JAC. We hope
	that you'll enjoy them and find them useful!
